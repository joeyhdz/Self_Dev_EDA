## Time Spent Learning Data Science:

When I was signing up for M.S in Data Science classes the advisor was giving me rules of thumb for expected time commitments I would 
likely need to make to be successful. 

Having absolutely no tech background I took her rules of thumb to heart and decided that if I was to have a chance at success it would
require that I treat this endeavor like a job. That idea then led me to tracking all of my time spent on studying/learning so that I could
hold myself accountable to a standard of "doing what was expected".

Not just an accountability tool, this time tracker grew into a visual testament of the journey thus far, chronicling each hour, each minute, each second dedicated to learning. It has now taken the form of a vibrant calendar heatmap, with each day's color intensity reflecting the time invested in honing my new craft.
Each cell of the heatmap is a chapter of this journey. The deeper the hue, the greater the effort that day. It's a remarkable way to reflect on my progress, identify trends, and continuously refine my learning strategies.

What started as a simple measure to ensure consistency has now evolved into a source of motivation and a badge of honor. Seeing the culmination of countless hours of hard work and dedication visualized so powerfully serves as a constant reminder of how far I've come, how much more is ahead, and how much I can achieve.

Echoing Lao Tzu's wisdom, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Here's to the countless steps taken, and the countless more to come! ðŸš€
I highly recommend this method to anyone embarking on a learning journey. It's not just about keeping track; it's about visualizing your story and your growth.
